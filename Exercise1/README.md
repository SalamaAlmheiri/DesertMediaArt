# Exercise 1: Neopixel RGB Color Sequence

For this assignment I used the neopixel on the featherboard to create a color sequence that changes from warm to cool colors. I wanted to experiment and see the range of colors that the neopixel can produce which is why I chose this sequence. Additionally, I made a small cardboard container which holds the feather with a piece of tissue on the top to project the neopixel light more clearly.  
Inside of the loop I added the code to change the color of the neopixel gradually changing from yellow, orange, red, pink, purple, blue turquoise, green then, it would loop. I also added a slight delay between each change of color to slow it down. 
I think next time I want to try to make a similar sequence but with a more natural transition between colors because in my code I tried to change the colors by manually writing the RGB numbers but there could be another way to change the numbers by using a formula.
