# Exercise 1: Neopixel RGB Color Sequence

For this assignment I used the neopixel on the featherboard to create a color sequence that changes from warm to cool colors. Additionally, I also made a small cardboard container which holds the feather with a piece of tissue on the top to project the neopixel light more clearly.
